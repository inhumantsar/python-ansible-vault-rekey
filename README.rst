Roll keys and re-encrypt secrets in any repo using Ansible Vault


* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://ansible-vault-rekey.readthedocs.io.

Usage
-----

WARNING: Very few guardrails present. Running this without options *will* overwrite data by default.

Known issues / caveats:

* Shows a callous disregard for whitespace and comments
* Assumes it's in a playbook directory if `-r` isn't provided
* Will casually write secrets to STDOUT in `--debug` mode

.. code-block::

    $ ansible-vault-rekey --help
    Usage: ansible-vault-rekey [OPTIONS]

      (Re)keys Ansible Vault repos.

    Options:
      --debug
      --dry-run                 Skip any action that would overwrite an original
                                file.
      -k, --keep-backups        Keep unencrypted copies of files after a
                                successful rekey.
      -r, --code-path TEXT      Path to Ansible code.
      -p, --password-file TEXT  Path to password file. Default: vault-password.txt
      -v, --vars-file TEXT      Only operate on the file specified. Default is to
                                check every YAML file in Ansible role/play dirs
                                for encrypted assets.
      --help                    Show this message and exit.


You can confirm that your secrets were rencryped properly by running debug on an
encrypted var or file. eg:

.. code-block::

    ansible --vault-password-file vault-password.txt -e "@group_vars/all.yml" -i localhost, -c local -m debug -a var=somesecurevar localhost


Installation
------------

.. code-block::

    pip install ansible-vault-rekey


We have dependencies a couple of layers down which need to compile crypto libraries
if you haven't already got them. On most systems, you'll need the following:

* libffi-dev / libffi-devel
* libssl-dev / openssl-devel
* gcc

Features
--------

* TODO

Testing
-------

With Docker (recommended):

.. code-block::

    docker build -t tmp . && docker run --rm -it -w /workspace -v $(pwd):/workspace tmp

Manually:

.. code-block::

    pip install -r requirements.txt pytest & python -m pytest tests/*.py
